.Sh NAME
.Nm stegdetect
.Nd finds image files with steganographic content
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.\" For a program:  program [-abc] file ...
.Nm stegdetect
.Op Fl V
.Op Fl s Ar float
.Op Fl d Ar num
.Op Fl t Ar tests
.Op Ar file ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility analyses image files for steganographic content.  It runs
statistical tests to determine if steganographic content is present,
and also tries to find the system that has been used to embed the
hidden information.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds_tests
.It Fl V
Displays the version number of the software.
.It Fl s Ar float
Changes the sensitivity of the detection algorithms.  Their results
are multiplied by the specified number.  The higher the number the
more sensitive the test will become.  The default is 1.
.It Fl d Ar num
Prints debug information.
.It Fl t Ar tests
Sets the tests that are being run on the image.  The following characters
are understood:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It j
Tests if information has been embedded with
.Tn jsteg .
.It o
Tests if information has been embedded with
.Tn outguess .
.It p
Tests if information has been embedded with
.Tn jphide .
.It i
Tests if information has been hidden with
.Tn invisible secrets .
.El
.Pp
The default value is
.Va jopi .
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility indicates the accuracy of the detection with a number of stars
behind the detected system.  If no filenames have been specified,
.Nm
will read the filenames from
.Dv stdin .
.\" The following requests should be uncommented and used where appropriate.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Cm stegdetect -t p auto.jpg
.Pp
Tries to detect the presence of
.Tn jphide
embedded information in
.Fa auto.jpg .
.\" This next request is for sections 2 and 3 function return values only.
.\" .Sh RETURN VALUES
.\" The next request is for sections 2 and 3 error and signal handling only.
.Sh ERRORS
.Nm
works only for
.Tn JPEG
images.
.Pp
Currently, there is no support for parameter training.  The only exported
knob is the sensitivity level.  Future versions will export all detection
parameters via a configuration file.
